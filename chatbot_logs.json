Here's a simple recipe for delicious pancakes:\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* 1 cup all-purpose flour\n* 2 tablespoons sugar\n* 2 teaspoons baking powder\n* 1/4 teaspoon salt\n* 1 cup milk\n* 1 large egg\n* 2 tablespoons melted butter (optional)\n* Butter or oil for greasing the pan\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. **In a large bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt**.\n2. **In a separate bowl, whisk together milk, egg, and melted butter (if using)**.\n3. **Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients** and stir until just combined. The batter should still be slightly lumpy.\n4. **Let the batter rest for 5-10 minutes** to allow the flour to absorb the liquid and the baking powder to activate.\n5. **Heat a non-stick pan or griddle over medium heat**. Grease with butter or cooking oil.\n6. **Using a 1/4 cup measuring cup, scoop batter onto the pan**. You can also use a ladle or spoon to pour in globs of batter.\n7. **Cook for 2-3 minutes**, until bubbles appear on the surface and the edges start to dry.\n8. **Flip the pancakes** and cook for another 1-2 minutes, until golden brown.\n9. **Serve hot** with your favorite toppings, such as syrup, butter, fresh fruit, or whipped cream.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Use buttermilk instead of regular milk for a tangier flavor.\n* Don't overmix the batter - this will lead to tough pancakes.\n* If you're new to making pancakes, try using a thermometer to ensure the pan is at the right temperature (around 375\u00b0F/190\u00b0C).\n* Experiment with different toppings and mix-ins, such as chocolate chips, nuts, or cinnamon.\n\nEnjoy your delicious homemade pancakes!", "metadata": {"session_id": "92cc8fae-ba56-408e-8eb8-9d4455ed2dec", "model": "llama3.2:latest", "response_time_seconds": 12.702153, "tokens_used": 441}}
